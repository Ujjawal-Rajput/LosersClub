# Room-Based Python Chat Project

This Python project enables users to create rooms, engage in real-time chat, and share images within those rooms. It utilizes Socket.IO for seamless communication, allowing both private conversations and interactions with strangers.

## Features

- **Room Creation:** Users can create their own chat rooms, each with a unique identifier.

- **Real-Time Chat:** Instantaneous communication within created rooms, supporting both text and image messages.

- **Image Sharing with Context:** Users can share images along with relevant context within the chat.

- **Anonymous Chat:** Strangers can join public rooms and participate in conversations with anonymity.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Backend server logic is implemented in Python.

- **Flask:** A web framework used for building the server.

- **Socket.IO:** Facilitates real-time communication between the server and clients.

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript:** Frontend components for the user interface.
